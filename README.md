# Delivery Comment Classification

A pipeline that removes stopwords, deletes punctuation, runs a count vectoriser, modifies the intergers into TF-IDF vectors and then runs a Multinomial Naive Bayes multilable classifier on some food delivery service comment text. I am attempting to classify the comments by there subject into 'food comments', 'delivery comments' or 'both'.
